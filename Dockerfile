# grading image (instructor-tools/Dockerfile.grading, kept in lockstep
# with this one). Installed at image-build time only; the grading
# container still runs with --network none at scoring time.

# Build the compiled tokenizer extension (submission/_fasttok.pyx) here,
# at image-build time, exactly as docs/SUBMISSION_INTERFACE.md
# ("Compiled extensions") requires: network is still available, and a
# one-time compile must not be charged against the index-build-time
# efficiency metric by happening inside build_index().
#
# This step is an optimisation, not a requirement. If it is removed, or
# fails, submission/indexer.py falls back to its pure-Python tokenizer and
# produces a byte-identical index -- see tests/test_tokenizer_parity.py.
